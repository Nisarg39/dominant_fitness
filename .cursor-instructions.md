# Cursor AI Custom Instructions - DOMINATE Performance

## 🚀 Quick Start for New Sessions

**ALWAYS start every new session by reading these files in order:**
1. `.cursor-workflow-config.json` - Workflow configuration
2. `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Project overview and current state
3. `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` - Architectural patterns and decisions
4. `CODING_STANDARDS.md` - Coding standards and best practices
5. `CURSOR_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` - Complete workflow guide

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Workflow

**MANDATORY: Follow this 4-step workflow for EVERY task:**

### Step 1: Analyst Agent - Context Analysis
- Read project context files
- Analyze current state using codebase_search
- Document findings and recommendations
- Output: Analysis report and context summary

### Step 2: Architect Agent - Solution Design  
- Review analyst findings
- Design solution architecture
- Create implementation plan
- Output: Architecture design and technical specs

### Step 3: Developer Agent - Implementation
- Review architecture plan
- Implement solution following established patterns
- Ensure code quality and standards compliance
- Output: Working implementation with tests

### Step 4: Analyst Agent - Quality Review
- Review implementation against requirements
- Check for errors and quality issues
- Verify architecture compliance
- Output: Quality report and final recommendations
